\section{Motivation:}

\noindent While numerous effective peak finders have been developed
for eukaryotic systems, we have found that the approaches used can be
suprisingly error prone when run on high-coverage bacterial and
archaeal ChIP-Seq datasets.

% Why not? Examples, evidence, hypothesis. 

\section{Results:}

\noindent We have developed Pique, a conceptually simple, easy to use
ChIP-Seq peak finding application for bacterial and archaeal ChIP-Seq
experiments. The software is cross-platform and Open Source, and based
on only Open Source dependencies. Output is provided in standardized
file formats, and may be easily imported by the Gaggle Genome Browser
for manual curation and data exploration, or into statistical and
graphics software such as R for further analysis.

\section{Availability:} 

\noindent The software is available under the BSD-3 license at

\href{http://github.com/ryneches/pique}{http://github.com/ryneches/pique}.

\noindent A tutorial and test data are included with the documentation.

\section{Introduction}

\noindent Next generation sequencing coupled with chromatin
immuno\-pre\-cipi\-tation (ChIP-Seq) is revolutionizing our ability to
genomically map protein-DNA interaction. The growing popularity of
ChIP-Seq has spurred the development of over thirty peak picking
algorithms (an extensive survey of these packages was conducted by
Wilbanks {\em et al.} \cite{wilbanks}). The relative performance of
representative peak detection algorithms on eukaryotic data, and
methods to assess performance have been recently reviewed by several
authors \cite{Pepke, Laajala_review, too_many_peak_callers,
  peakranger, peak_benchmark}.

While ChIP-Seq has been predominantly used to interrogate protein-DNA
interactions in eukaryotic systems, it is an especially powerful tool
for studying microbes. The small genomes and rapid growth rates, as
well as the extensive repertoire of experimental genetic tools
available for microbial systems permit ChIP-Seq to provide a
particularly clear picture of the sate of a cell's transcriptional
regulatory machinery.

However, only one ChIP-Seq analysis tool, CSDeconv \cite{CSDeconv},
has been explicitly developed for microbial data. This MATLAB package
successfully finds peaks in microbial ChIP-Seq data, but its
application is limited by its dependency on costly proprietary
software, slow performance, lack of support for manual
curation. Herein we describe Pique, a conceptually simple,
Python-based peak finding package that enables easy and rapid peak
finding in bacterial and archaeal ChIP-Seq datasets.

\section{Approach}

\noindent ChIP-Seq in bacteria and archaea yields coverage several
orders of magnitude larger than in eukaryotic systems, resulting in
continuous coverage rather than the sparse coverage typically present
in eukaryotic ChIP-Seq data.  This feature of microbial ChIP-Seq
experiments permits simpler, faster algorithms to be used. We have
based our algorithm on classic noise reduction techniques from signal
processing.

Pique is designed for use in systems that have genomic complexities
such as IS elements, gene dosage polymorphisms and accessory genomes
that cause coverage variations unrelated to ChIP, or in cases where
the organism under study is not identical to the reference genome. The
resulting enrichment ``pedestals'' and ``holes'' can be problematic
for detecting peaks and calculating enrichment levels. If the user
provides a map of these features, the software will automatically
perform a segmented analysis.

The wide variety of microbial systems, target proteins, protocols, and
experimental conditions calls for tailored statistical approaches to
ChIP-Seq. Rather than attempting to anticipate each of these (and
their combinations) with a very large number of statistical and
heuristic parameters, we have chosen to focus on the aspects of the
analysis that are common to all ChIP-Seq experiments; finding putative
peaks, estimating binding coordinates and binding affinities. The
determination of statistical significance is typically straightforward
for any particular experiment, but is quite difficult to robustly
generalize.

Pique allows users to create high-quality peak lists in two ways.
First, for each peak reported we report metrics that can be used to
ascertain which peaks are statistically significant (usually, this
involves little more than sorting the table and choosing a
cutoff). Second, we provide integrated support for curation using the
Gaggle Genome Browser. This permits interactive curation of the peak
list and analysis of the ChIP-Seq data in the context of other
Gaggle-enabled resources. Interactive curation of a microbial ChIP-Seq
data set can typically be completed in a few minutes.

\begin{methods}
\section{Methods}

\noindent Pique requires BAM files as input\cite{sam_format}.
Therefore, prior to using Pique, reads should first be quality
filtered, quality trimmed, and aligned to a reference genome (ideally,
all contigs of the reference genome should be used as the mapping
target).

By default, Pique treats each contig as a single analysis region, but
the user may designate regions within a contig for separate analysis.
This may be useful when coverage levels are systematically altered
over large regions.  Pique supports three features types; analysis
regions, masking regions, and normalization regions. Masking regions
are simply masked out of their respective analysis regions, and are
useful for removing coverage variation due to repetitive
DNA. Normalization regions selected within an analysis region are used
to compensate for total coverage discrepancies between the background
and ChIP alignments.

The user launches the analysis by providing alignment an file for the
ChIP data, an alignment file for the control data, and a coverage
feature map. The primary analysis proceeds as follows :

\begin{itemize}

\item The alignment files are digested into numeric coverage tracks,
  and the analysis regions are initialized in memory. Masking regions
  are applied.

%\item The coverage noise threshold is measured by comparing the total
%  coverage within the normalization regions between the ChIP data and
%  the control data. (Normalization regions must contain neither peaks
%  nor coverage level aberrations.)

% This no longer happens in the current version, as of August 18, 2011
%
%\item In each analysis region, the ``DC'' component is removed using
%  linear detrending. This removes effects due to coverage variation
%  features larger than about 100Kb.

\item High-$k$ noise is removed using a Wiener-Kolmogorov filter. The
  filter delay $\alpha$ is chosen to approximate to the expected
  footprint size of the targeted protein. The choice of filter implies
  the existence of two inputs; a ``true'' signal, and a noise
  source. Both are assumed to be stationary stochastic processes
  combined additively.

  % The Wiener-Kolmogorov filter was the first and simplest
  % statistical signal filter, first published by Norbert Wiener in
  % 1949, and independently derived in discrete-time form by Andrey
  % Kolmogorov in 1941.

\item A Blackman window of a diameter equal to the read length is
  convolved with the filtered coverage track to remove features
  smaller than one read. This reduces the effect of fragmentation
  position bias, and may be especially useful when transposon-based
  library construction is used.

\item The noise threshold in the ChIP coverage track is measured by
  comparing the coverage distribution in the ChIP track to the control
  track within user-annotated non-peak regions. Features that exceed
  the noise threshold are identified.

\item Because read orientations are constrained by the fragment size,
  binding events cause a offset enrichment between the forward and
  reverse strands. Pique exploits this by requiring that the stop
  coordinate of the forward strand enrichment envelope must fall
  between the coordinates of the reverse strand enrichment envelope,
  and that the start coordinate of the reverse strand enrichment
  envelope fall between the coordinates of the forward strand
  enrichment envelope. (We call this the overlap criterion.)

\end{itemize}

% FIXME : The overlap criterion is a very crude version of the
% heuristic models other peak callers user. We should say something
% here about these models, and why decided not to use them.

\noindent For each putative peak, Pique calculates the enrichment
ratio of the ChIP alignment to the control alignment, the binding
coordinate, and the enrichment normalization factor for that analysis
region. 

\end{methods}

\section{Discussion}

Pique does not attempt to filter peaks that are statistically
insignificant. We have found that this part of the analysis is usually
specific to the data and to the experiment, and can be highly
idiosyncratic. Pique is designed to achieve a low false-negative
rate. This allows Pique to work without modification on many different
kinds of experiments, but at the cost of some post-filtering. Pique
provides the user with output that can be used to support a variety of
such statistical tests.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    {\resizebox{\imsize}{!}{\includegraphics{pique_csd_ranks.pdf}}}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Performance of Pique and CSDeconv on a ChIP-seq tfbD in
    {\em Halobacterium salinarum} sp. NRC1. Pique recovers more peaks
    from the dataset than CSDeconv, and more of these peak regions
    contain a predicted transcription start site. Both software
    packages recovered the same number of peaks containing the
    predicted binding motif and peaks containing transcript start
    sites less than 50bp downstream from the binding
    motif.}\label{fig:02}
\end{figure}

Some recommended filtering might include eliminating peaks that are
significantly narrower than the size range of the sequencing library,
peaks with a normalized enrichment ratio below unity, or peaks that
have predicted binding sites that are very skewed from the center of
the enriched region. Depending on how many peaks are recovered, the
user may wish to try one or all of these, perhaps with
clustering. However, if a ``perfect'' peak list is required, we have
found that heuristic filtering is inadequate regardless of the
software used. To facilitate manual curation, Pique outputs a track
file of the coverage, a quantitative positional data of the estimated
binding sites, and a bookmark file annotating the peaks. These files
are simple to process by a variety of tools, and can be loaded
directly into the Gaggle Genome Browser. False positives are easy to
recognize visually, and can be easily deleted.\footnote{See
  supplementary figure.}

\section{Conclusion}

We conclude that Pique provides a rapid, open source platform for the
sensitive detection of transcription factor binding sites in bacterial
and archaeal ChIP-seq experiments. We leverage standard signal
processing algorithms to rapidly identify binding sites. Downstream
analysis is supported via integration with statistical and graphics
software such as R, and curation via integration with the
user-friendly Gaggle Genome Browser and the suite of Gaggle tools.

We note that Pique should also work well with eukaryotic datasets
provided they are gathered with greater coverage than has been
previously reported.
