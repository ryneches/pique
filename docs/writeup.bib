    abstract = {{SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a
                  generic alignment format for storing read alignments
                  against reference sequences, supporting short and
                  long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different
                  sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style,
                  compact in size, efficient in random access and is
                  the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes
                  Project are released. SAMtools implements various
                  utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM
                  format, such as indexing, variant caller and
                  alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools

@article{gaggle,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Systems biologists work with many kinds of
                  data, from many different sources, using a variety
                  of software tools. Each of these tools typically
                  excels at one type of analysis, such as of
                  microarrays, of metabolic networks and of predicted
                  protein structure. A crucial challenge is to combine
                  the capabilities of these (and other forthcoming)
                  data resources and tools to create a data
                  exploration and analysis environment that does
                  justice to the variety and complexity of systems
                  biology data sets. A solution to this problem should
                  recognize that data types, formats and software in
                  this high throughput age of biology are constantly
                  changing.RESULTS:In this paper we describe the
                  Gaggle -a simple, open-source Java software
                  environment that helps to solve the problem of
                  software and database integration. Guided by the
                  classic software engineering strategy of separation
                  of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it
                  integrates existing popular programs and web
                  resources into a user-friendly, easily-extended
                  environment.We demonstrate that four simple data
                  types (names, matrices, networks, and associative
                  arrays) are sufficient to bring together diverse
                  databases and software. We highlight some
                  capabilities of the Gaggle with an exploration of
                  Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we
                  identify a putative ricin-like protein -a discovery
                  made possible by simultaneous data exploration using
                  a wide range of publicly available data and a
                  variety of popular bioinformatics software
                  tools.CONCLUSION:We have integrated diverse
                  databases (for example, KEGG, BioCyc, String) and
                  software (Cytoscape, DataMatrixViewer, R statistical
                  environment, and TIGR Microarray Expression
                  Viewer). Through this loose coupling of diverse
                  software and databases the Gaggle enables
                  simultaneous exploration of experimental data (mRNA
                  and protein abundance, protein-protein and
                  protein-DNA interactions), functional associations
                  (operon, chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic
                  pattern), metabolic pathways (KEGG) and Pubmed
                  abstracts (STRING web resource), creating an
                  exploratory environment useful to 'web browser and
                  spreadsheet biologists', to statistically savvy
                  computational biologists, and those in between. The
                  Gaggle uses Java RMI and Java Web Start technologies

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:High-density tiling arrays and new
                  sequencing technologies are generating rapidly
                  increasing volumes of transcriptome and protein-DNA
                  interaction data. Visualization and exploration of
                  this data is critical to understanding the
                  regulatory logic encoded in the genome by which the
                  cell dynamically affects its physiology and
                  interacts with its environment.RESULTS:The Gaggle
                  Genome Browser is a cross-platform desktop program
                  for interactively visualizing high-throughput data
                  in the context of the genome. Important features
                  include dynamic panning and zooming, keyword search
                  and open interoperability through the Gaggle
                  framework. Users may bookmark locations on the
                  genome with descriptive annotations and share these
                  bookmarks with other users. The program handles
                  large sets of user-generated data using an
                  in-process database and leverages the facilities of
                  SQL and the R environment for importing and
                  manipulating data.A key aspect of the Gaggle Genome
                  Browser is interoperability. By connecting to the
                  Gaggle framework, the genome browser joins a suite
                  of interconnected bioinformatics tools for analysis
                  and visualization with connectivity to major public
                  repositories of sequences, interactions and
                  pathways. To this flexible environment for exploring
                  and combining data, the Gaggle Genome Browser adds
                  the ability to visualize diverse types of data in
                  relation to its coordinates on the
                  genome.CONCLUSIONS:Genomic coordinates function as a
                  common key by which disparate biological data types
                  can be related to one another. In the Gaggle Genome
                  Browser, heterogeneous data are joined by their
                  location on the genome to create information-rich
                  visualizations yielding insight into genome
                  organization, transcription and its regulation and,
                  ultimately, a better understanding of the mechanisms
                  that enable the cell to dynamically respond to its
                  environment.}},

                  throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is rapidly becoming
                  the method of choice for discovering cell-specific
                  transcription factor binding locations genome
                  wide. By aligning sequenced tags to the genome,
                  binding locations appear as peaks in the tag
                  profile. Several programs have been designed to
                  identify such peaks, but program evaluation has been
                  difficult due to the lack of benchmark data sets. We
                  have created benchmark data sets for three
                  transcription factors by manually evaluating a
                  selection of potential binding regions that cover
                  typical variation in peak size and
                  appearance. Performance of five programs on this
                  benchmark showed, first, that external control or
                  background data was essential to limit the number of
                  false positive peaks from the programs. However,
                  >80\% of these peaks could be manually filtered out
                  by visual inspection alone, without using additional
                  background data, showing that peak shape information
                  is not fully exploited in the evaluated
                  programs. Second, none of the programs returned
                  peak-regions that corresponded to the actual
                  resolution in ChIP-seq data. Our results showed that
                  ChIP-seq peaks should be narrowed down to
                  100–400 bp, which is sufficient to identify unique
                  peaks and binding sites. Based on these results, we
                  propose a meta-approach that gives improved peak
                  definitions.}},

                  coupled with massively parallel short-read
                  sequencing (seq) is used to probe chromatin
                  dynamics. Although there are many algorithms to call
                  peaks from ChIP-seq datasets, most are tuned either
                  to handle punctate sites, such as transcriptional
                  factor binding sites, or broad regions, such as
                  histone modification marks; few can do both. Other
                  algorithms are limited in their configurability,
                  performance on large data sets, and ability to
                  distinguish closely-spaced peaks.RESULTS:In this
                  paper, we introduce PeakRanger, a peak caller
                  software package that works equally well on punctate
                  and broad sites, can resolve closely-spaced peaks,
                  has excellent performance, and is easily
                  customized. In addition, PeakRanger can be run in a
                  parallel cloud computing environment to obtain
                  extremely high performance on very large data
                  sets. We present a series of benchmarks to evaluate
                  PeakRanger against 10 other peak callers, and
                  demonstrate the performance of PeakRanger on both
                  real and synthetic data sets. We also present real
                  world usages of PeakRanger, including peak-calling
                  in the modENCODE project.CONCLUSIONS:Compared to
                  other peak callers tested, PeakRanger offers
                  improved resolution in distinguishing extremely
                  closely-spaced peaks. PeakRanger has above-average
                  spatial accuracy in terms of identifying the precise
                  location of binding events. PeakRanger also has
                  excellent sensitivity and specificity in all
                  benchmarks evaluated. In addition, PeakRanger offers
                  significant improvements in run time when running on
                  a single processor system, and very marked
                  improvements when allowed to take advantage of the
                  MapReduce parallel environment offered by a cloud

                  spectacular advances in the determination of genomic
                  sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
                  massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) promises to
                  give better insight into transcription regulation by
                  locating sites of protein–DNA interactions. Such

@article{Laajala_review,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with
                  massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is
                  increasingly being applied to study transcriptional
                  regulation on a genome-wide scale. While numerous
                  algorithms have recently been proposed for analysing
                  the large ChIP-seq datasets, their relative merits
                  and potential limitations remain unclear in
                  practical applications.RESULTS:The present study
                  compares the state-of-the-art algorithms for
                  detecting transcription factor binding sites in four
                  diverse ChIP-seq datasets under a variety of
                  practical research settings. First, we demonstrate
                  how the biological conclusions may change
                  dramatically when the different algorithms are
                  applied. The reproducibility across biological
                  replicates is then investigated as an internal
                  validation of the detections. Finally, the predicted
                  binding sites with each method are compared to
                  high-scoring binding motifs as well as binding
                  regions confirmed in independent qPCR
                  experiments.CONCLUSIONS:In general, our results
                  indicate that the optimal choice of the
                  computational approach depends heavily on the
                  dataset under analysis. In addition to revealing
                  valuable information to the users of this technology
                  about the characteristics of the binding site
                  detection approaches, the systematic evaluation
                  framework provides also a useful reference to the

                  analysis of regulatory logic in both bacteria and

                  of alternate regulatory mechanisms through
                  genome-wide characterization of transcript
                  structures of 64\% of all genes, including putative
                  non-coding RNAs in Halobacterium salinarum

                  life requires the assembly of large multiprotein
                  complexes at DNA promoters before RNA polymerase
                  (RNAP)-catalyzed transcript synthesis. Core RNAP
                  subunits show homology among the three domains of
                  life, and recent structural information supports
                  this homology. General transcription factors are
                  required for productive transcription initiation
                  complex formation. The archaeal general
                  transcription factors TATA-element-binding protein
                  (TBP), which mediates promoter recognition, and
                  transcription factor B (TFB), which mediates
                  recruitment of RNAP, show extensive homology to
                  eukaryal TBP and TFIIB. Crystallographic information
                  is becoming available for fragments of transcription
                  initiation complexes (e.g. RNAP, TBP-TFB-DNA,
                  TBP-TFIIB-DNA), but understanding the molecular
                  topography of complete initiation complexes still
                  requires biochemical and biophysical
                  characterization of protein-protein and protein-DNA
                  interactions. In published work, systematic
                  site-specific protein-DNA photocrosslinking has been
                  used to define positions of RNAP subunits and
                  general transcription factors in bacterial and
                  eukaryal initiation complexes. In this work, we have
                  used systematic site-specific protein-DNA
                  photocrosslinking to define positions of RNAP
                  subunits and general transcription factors in an
                  archaeal initiation complex. Employing a set of 41
                  derivatized DNA fragments, each having a phenyl
                  azide photoactivable crosslinking agent incorporated
                  at a single, defined site within positions -40 to +1
                  of the gdh promoter of the hyperthermophilic marine
                  archaea, Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf), we have
                  determined the locations of PfRNAP subunits PfTBP
                  and PfTFB relative to promoter DNA. The resulting
                  topographical information supports the striking
                  homology with the eukaryal initiation complex and
                  permits one major new conclusion, which is that
                  PfTFB interacts with promoter DNA not only in the
                  TATA-element region but also in the
                  transcription-bubble region, near the transcription
                  start site. Comparison with crystallographic
                  information implicates the PfTFB N-terminal domain
                  in the interaction with the transcription-bubble
                  region. The results are discussed in relation to the
                  known effects of substitutions in the TFB and TFIIB
                  N-terminal domains on transcription initiation and

    abstract = {{MOTIVATION: To illustrate an intuitive and
                  statistically valid method for combining independent
                  sources of evidence that yields a p-value for the
                  complete evidence, and to apply it to the problem of
                  detecting simultaneous matches to multiple patterns
                  in sequence homology searches. RESULTS: In sequence
                  analysis, two or more (approximately) independent
                  measures of the membership of a sequence (or
                  sequence region) in some class are often
                  available. We would like to estimate the likelihood
                  of the sequence being a member of the class in view
                  of all the available evidence. An example is
                  estimating the significance of the observed match of
                  a macromolecular sequence (DNA or protein) to a set
                  of patterns (motifs) that characterize a biological
                  sequence family. An intuitive way to do this is to
                  express each piece of evidence as a p-value, and
                  then use the product of these p-values as the
                  measure of membership in the family. We derive a
                  formula and algorithm (QFAST) for calculating the
                  statistical distribution of the product of n
                  independent p-values. We demonstrate that sorting
                  sequences by this p-value effectively combines the
                  information present in multiple motifs, leading to
                  highly accurate and sensitive sequence homology
                  searches.}},

@article{STAMP,
    abstract = {{Transcription factor (TF) proteins recognize a small
                  number of DNA sequences with high specificity and
                  control the expression of neighbouring genes. The
                  evolution of TF binding preference has been the
                  subject of a number of recent studies, in which
                  generalized binding profiles have been introduced
                  and used to improve the prediction of new target
                  sites. Generalized profiles are generated by
                  aligning and merging the individual profiles of
                  related TFs. However, the distance metrics and
                  alignment algorithms used to compare the binding
                  profiles have not yet been fully explored or
                  optimized. As a result, binding profiles depend on
                  TF structural information and sometimes may ignore
                  important distinctions between
                  subfamilies. Prediction of the identity or the
                  structural class of a protein that binds to a given
                  DNA pattern will enhance the analysis of microarray
                  and ChIP-chip data where frequently multiple
                  putative targets of usually unknown TFs are
                  predicted. Various comparison metrics and alignment
                  algorithms are evaluated (a total of 105
                  combinations). We find that local alignments are
                  generally better than global alignments at detecting
                  eukaryotic DNA motif similarities, especially when
                  combined with the sum of squared distances or
                  Pearson's correlation coefficient comparison
                  metrics. In addition, multiple-alignment strategies
                  for binding profiles and tree-building methods are
                  tested for their efficiency in constructing
                  generalized binding models. A new method for
                  automatic determination of the optimal number of
                  clusters is developed and applied in the
                  construction of a new set of familial binding
                  profiles which improves upon TF classification
                  accuracy. A software tool, STAMP, is developed to
                  host all tested methods and make them publicly
                  available. This work provides a high quality
                  reference set of familial binding profiles and the
                  first comprehensive platform for analysis of DNA
                  profiles. Detecting similarities between DNA motifs
                  is a key step in the comparative study of
                  transcriptional regulation, and the work presented
                  here will form the basis for tool and method
                  development for future transcriptional modeling

@article{LexA_binding_motif,
    abstract = {{ Genomes of eukaryotic organisms are packaged into
                  nucleosomes that restrict the binding of
                  transcription factors to accessible
                  regions. Bacteria do not contain histones, but they
                  have nucleoid-associated proteins that have been
                  proposed to function analogously. Here, we combine
                  chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-density
                  oligonucleotide microarrays to define the in vivo
                  DNA targets of the LexA transcriptional repressor in
                  Escherichia coli. We demonstrate a near-universal
                  relationship between the presence of a LexA sequence
                  motif, LexA binding in vitro, and LexA binding in
                  vivo, suggesting that a suitable recognition site
                  for LexA is sufficient for binding in
                  vivo. Consistent with this observation, LexA binds
                  comparably to ectopic target sites introduced at
                  various positions in the genome. We also identify
                  approximately 20 novel LexA targets that lack a
                  canonical LexA sequence motif, are not bound by LexA
                  in vitro, and presumably require an additional
                  factor for binding in vivo. Our results indicate
                  that, unlike eukaryotic genomes, the E. coli genome
                  is permissive to transcription factor binding. The
                  permissive nature of the E. coli genome has
                  important consequences for the nature of
                  transcriptional regulatory proteins, biological
                  specificity, and evolution.  }},
